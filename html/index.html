     <h1>Welcome to the Flash Games Archive.</h1>
     <p>This is a quick website made using Ruffle and GitHub. If you want the original repo to download the games, go to <a href="https://github.com/Games-From-Flash/sw">GitHub (Clickable Link)</a> and all of the SWF files should be there, along with all of the HTML files that I used to make this site.</p>
